Gene and tissue specific gene enrichment:

After implementing horizontal alignment(or naive comparison) on 92 selected samples, for each sample, top 500 non-overlapping segments are extracted. Genes(and tissue specific genes) on top 500 segments are counted sample by sample. 

Gene list is: experimentsettings/genelist/geneidprocessed
Tissue specific gene lists are in: experimentsettings/tsgenelist/

Enrichment data: matrix file named as {Tissue}enrich{gene/tsgene}

lines are define by {Tissue}samples
columns are EpiBLAST_naive(naive attention score), EpiBLAST_up(unpredictibility), naive comparison
