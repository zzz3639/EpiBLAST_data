hierarchical clustering:

data(15 states, core_18 samples, 92 in total, 1-73 used) :
scoreans_core18: Horizontal alignment with attention score "Naive"
scoreans_attention_core18: Horizontal alignment with attention score "Unpredictability"


matlab command:
Y = pdist(scoreans_core18(:,1:73)', 'correlation');
Z = linkage(Y,'average');

    Distance: 1.0 minus correlation
    Z = linkage(X,METHOD) creates a hierarchical cluster tree using the specified algorithm. The available methods are:
    'average'   --- unweighted average distance (UPGMA) (also known as group average)
