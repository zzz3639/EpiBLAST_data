top 500 non-overlapping segments of E003 are selected and compared in pairwise in this analysis. 

For segment i and segment j, maximal local alignment score from EpiBLAST_naive(naive attention score) is computed and treated as the similarity of these two segments. The score is stored in the entry [i,j] of a matrix M of size 500*500. Hierarchical clustering on M is implemented followed by.

In the hierarchical clustering, distance matrix D is defined by 1-M/u/1.1 (diag(D)=0), u is the largest number of all the non-diagonal elements of M.

In hierarchical clustering, distance between two clusters is defined by unweighted average distance (also known as group average).

We found that top 500 segments are indeed clustered. This heat map also tells us there is hierarchical structure(detailed clusters inside a large cluster) inside this top 500 segment assembly.
